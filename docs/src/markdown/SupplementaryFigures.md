# Coordination number in the bulk solution.

    **Coordination Number Calculation**

	Coordination numbers were computed using the **bulk_coordination()** function available in the [MolSimToolkit.jl](https://m3g.github.io/MolSimToolkit.jl/) package. It computes the coordination number of one type of solvent molecule relative to another solvent molecule, as a function of the distance to a reference solute molecule.

	Effectively, the maximum distance to the solute considered for a solvent molecule to be coordinated is set to 5 Å in the following plots. 

	The concentrations represent the actual bulk concentrations of the ionic liquids, calculated after system equilibration.
