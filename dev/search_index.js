The plot illustrates that from 0.5 to 1.5 mol L⁻¹, the presence of [BMIM]⁺ results in greater IL accumulation around the protein. However, at higher concentrations (>1.5 mol L⁻¹), [EMIM]⁺ shows less preferential exclusion. As the concentration increases, the preferential solvation parameter generally becomes negative, indicating a shift in solvation dynamics. </figcaption> </figure>","category":"page"}]
